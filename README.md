## Modeling Human Fecundability 

We are specifically interested in the factors that may impact the probability of a healthy live birth and developing predictions on the extent of pregnancy loss at various stages in development. 

### Directory structure

1. `src`: directory for main source code for modeling
2. `notebooks`: directory for plotting via Jupyter notebooks
3. `data`: directory for intermediate data tables from papers used to set expected behavior.
