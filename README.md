## Modeling Human Fecundability 

We are specifically interested in the factors that may impact the probability of a healthy live birth and developing predictions on the extent of pregnancy loss at various stages in development. 

### Directory structure

1. `src`: directory for main source code for modeling
2. `notebooks`: directory for plotting via Jupyter notebooks
3. `data`: directory for intermediate data tables from papers used to set expected behavior.
4. `doc`: directory with method documentation in LaTeX

### Data

We used pregnancy-outcome data from the following studies:

```
Maternal age and fetal loss: population based register linkage study
Anne-Marie Nybo Andersen, Jan Wohlfahrt, Peter Christens, Jørn Olsen, Mads Melbye
BMJ. 2000

Role of maternal age and pregnancy history in risk of miscarriage: prospective register based study
Maria C Magnus, Allen J Wilcox, Nils-Halvdan Morken, Clarice R Weinberg,  Siri E Håberg
